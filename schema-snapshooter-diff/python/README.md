# Schema Snapshooter Diff (Python)

This directory contains the Python implementation of the Schema Snapshooter Diff utility, part of the larger `cross-language-data-utilities` project. This package provides command-line tools and a programmatic interface for capturing, comparing, and validating data schemas.

## Project Structure

The Python project's key files and directories are structured as follows:

```

python/ # Root directory for the Python project
├── pyproject.toml # Project metadata, dependencies, and build configuration
├── README.md # Documentation for this Python package
├── LICENSE # Licensing information for the Python package
├── schema_snapshooter_diff/ # The core Python package source code
│   ├── __init__.py # Marks this as a Python package
│   ├── cli.py # Command-line interface definitions
│   ├── main.py # Main application entry point or core logic
│   └── schema_logic.py # Core schema handling logic
└── tests/ # Contains all test files for the Python package
    └── cli/ # Tests specifically for the CLI components
        └── test_cli.py # CLI test cases

## Installation

To set up and use this Python package, ensure you have Python 3.10+ installed.

1.  Navigate into the Python project directory:
    ```bash
    cd schema-snapshooter-diff/python
    ```
2.  Install the package in editable mode along with its core dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -e .
    ```

## Usage

The primary way to interact with the utility is via its command-line interface:

```bash
# From the 'schema-snapshooter-diff/python' directory:
python -m schema_snapshooter_diff.cli --help
````

**(Add specific command examples for `get`, `compare`, `validate` here once they are implemented/finalized.)**

## Development

For local development and running tests:

1. 1.  Follow the [Installation](https://www.google.com/search?q=%23installation) steps.
1. 2.  Install development dependencies (currently `pytest` for testing):Bash
